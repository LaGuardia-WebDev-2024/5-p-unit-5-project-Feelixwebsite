<hi>Why Life Is Strange 2 is the best game ive ever played</hi>
 <p>I would go as far as to call myself a choice based story game connoisseur- with my credentials being my completion of Detroit Become Human, The Walking Dead, Untill Dawn, and many others.</p>

  <p>However- no game ive played so far has come close to the masterpiece that is Life is strange 2. It's dramatic with an interesting concept, lovable characters and a fantastic adition to the universe the original sory takes place in.</p>

  <p>To understand the second game, you need some context from the first.</p>

  <h2>Life is strange, the begining</h2>
  
  <p>The original story takes place in a small town in Oregon called Arcadia Bay. You play as Max Caufield, an 18 year old photography student who finds out she has the ability to travel back in time. She rekindles her friendship with her childhood best friend, Chloe Price, and together they begin their search for a mysterious missing girl, Rachel Amber.</p>
  <p>Throughout the game you make decisions that effect how Max moves through the story. Whenever you make an important choice, a butterfly appears in the top right corner with text underneath reading "This action will have consequences." If you arent sure about your choice, you can rewind and try again. But, you wont know how the choice effects the story until later.</p>
  <p>Overall, the game is about dealing with the consequences of your actions, and is a reminder that you only have one shot, you cant just undo it. </p>
