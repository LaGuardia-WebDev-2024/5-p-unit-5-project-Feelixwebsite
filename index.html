<hi>Why Life Is Strange 2 is the best game ive ever played</hi>
 <p>I would go as far as to call myself a choice based story game connoisseur- with my credentials being my completion of Detroit Become Human, The Walking Dead, Untill Dawn, and many others.</p>

  <p>However- no game ive played so far has come close to the masterpiece that is Life is strange 2. It's dramatic with an interesting concept, lovable characters and a fantastic adition to the universe the original sory takes place in.</p>

  <p>To understand the second game, you need some context from the first.</p>
